                    <p>Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative
                        position
                        and
                        direction.[1] In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear
                        dimensions,
                        although
                        modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional
                        continuum
                        known as
                        spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an
                        understanding of
                        the
                        physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is
                        itself an
                        entity, a
                        relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.

                <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even
                    electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it.[2] The theory of general relativity
                    predicts
                    that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[3][4] The boundary of no
                    escape
                    is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an
                    object
                    crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways,
                    a black
                    hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in
                    curved
                    spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black
                    body of a
                    temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a
                    kelvin
                    for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.<a

                <h2>Milky Way</h2>
                <p>The Milky Way[a] is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's
                    appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be
                    individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via
                    lactea,
                    from the Greek γαλακτικός κύκλος (galaktikos kýklos), meaning "milky circle."[20][21][22] From
                    Earth, the
                    Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei
                    first
                    resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s,
                    most
                    astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[23] Following the
                    1920 Great
                    Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,[24] observations by Edwin Hubble
                    showed that
                    the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.<a

                <h2>Stars</h2>
                <p>A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its
                    gravity. The
                    nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their
                    immense
                    distance from Earth makes them appear as fixed points of light in the sky. The most prominent stars
                    have
                    been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper
                    names.
                    Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized
                    stellar
                    designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars. Still, most are
                    invisible to
                    the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.<a
