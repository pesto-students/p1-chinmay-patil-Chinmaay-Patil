The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of 100,000–200,000 light-years. Recent
simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2
million light-years.[12][13] The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies,
which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.[25][26]

It is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars[27][28] and at least that number of planets.[29][30] The Solar System
is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years from the Galactic Center,[3] on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one
of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one
or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The galactic center is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*, a
supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034) million solar masses.[31][32] Stars and gases at a wide range of distances
from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotational speed appears to
contradict the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much (about 90%)[33][34] of the mass of the Milky Way is
invisible to telescopes, neither emitting nor absorbing electromagnetic radiation. This conjectural mass has been termed
"dark matter".[35] The rotational period is about 240 million years at the radius of the Sun.[17] The Milky Way as a
whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The
oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark
Ages of the Big Bang.[36]
