A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen,
along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. The total mass is the main factor determining its evolution and
eventual fate. A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its
core. This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior, radiating into outer space. At the end of a
star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or—if it is sufficiently massive—a
black hole.

Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than
lithium. Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. They
are then recycled into new stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass, age, metallicity
(chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space—by carrying out observations of a star's
apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time.

Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of planetary systems and star systems
with two or more stars. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can
significantly impact their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a
star cluster or a galaxy.
